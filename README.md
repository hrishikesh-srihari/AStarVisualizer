# AStarVisualizer
This project is a visualization of the A-Star pathfinding algorithm using the PyGame module in Python3.

To use the program:

1. Run the program in your IDE of choice.
2. The first left click places the start node of the path.
3. The second left click places the end node of the path.
4. By left clicking on the grid (after the start and end nodes are placed), you place barriers for the algorithm to navigate.
5. Right click can be used on any filled in point to erase it and/or place it elsewhere on the grid.
6. Once all desired points are placed on the grid, click the enter/return key to start the visualization. **

** Keep in mind that both the start and end nodes need to be placed prior to starting the visualization.
